                    <p>"ContractSimple" is an accountless contract management platform built on the <a href='https://www.jpmorgan.com/country/CL/ES/Quorum' target="_blank">Quorum</a> blockchain.</p>

                    <p>Hashes of documents, and other metadata, are stored on your permissioned or internal Quorum blockchain. Files are stored
                        separatedly. We are not creating a token, but rather using Quorum's blockchain and privacy benefits to record
                        metadata, permissions, and proof of ownership that can be queried and used for permission/access
                        control through our front end UI.</p>

                    <p>Never lose track of a Contract again.</p>
